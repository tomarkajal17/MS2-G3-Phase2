After the UI you have to configure the ICU
##### The Web Service will work for any numbers of beds in the ICU but the UI parts are fixed for 6 numbers of beds.
##### so use 6 beds in totals no of beds field.
##### Allocate PatientId to patient and click on allocate patient so in ICU one of the bed will be allocated to that patient.
##### In the ICU Patient Monitoring you can perform the following action.
##### After allocation of patient you can start monitoring the patient by clicking the button. In which for each patient random data(Patient Spo2, temperature and pulse rate) will be generated. On that basis patient will be classified into two healthy or unhealthy. If that data voilates the condition they it will show critical otherwise healthy.
